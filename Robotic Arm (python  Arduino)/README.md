# ROBOTIC ARM (Python and Arduino)

#### This was the part of modefying the jarvis program that i made implementing futher leads to more iot and electronics ,and futher added the robotic arm (with 4-servo-motors)
#### i buyed stuffs from amazon which is easily availabe

## Features

#### For a cool demo of this project watch this /coming soon [YouTube video]()

There are two feature added one is :

- picking up stuffs 
- droping the stuffs


  
## Installation
I used Pycharm IDE to code python
and arduino IDE for uno

You can directly run the code to see in action
see the ports before running
so i am mentioning here!
- port = 'COM7'  (cheak ur com port and modefy)
- pin1 = 11  # hand/Gripper         --red
- pin2 = 10  # rotation/base        --black
- pin3 = 9   # up down/sholder      --orange
- pin4 = 8   # middle/waist         --yellow

## Future Improvements
- Generalized conversations can be made possible by incorporating Natural Language Processing
- GUI can be made more nicer to look at and functional
- More functionalities can be added
